# Installing GetContacts

Here are the steps to install GetContacts using Conda:

1.  **Create a Conda environment:**

    ```bash
    conda create -n getcontact python=2.7
    ```

    * This command creates a new Conda environment named "getcontact" with Python 2.7.  GetContacts has some dependencies that are easier to manage with Python 2.7.

2.  **Activate the Conda environment:**

    ```bash
    conda activate getcontact
    ```

    * This command activates the "getcontact" environment, so that subsequent packages are installed within this isolated environment. This helps to avoid conflicts with other Python installations or packages.

3.  **Install required packages:**

    ```bash
    conda install scipy numpy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas cython
    conda install conda-forge/label/cf202003::vmd-python
    ```

    * This installs several essential scientific computing packages:
        * `scipy`: For scientific computing functions.
        * `numpy`: For numerical operations (arrays, etc.).
        * `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms.
        * `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualization.
        * `pandas`: For data analysis and manipulation.
        * `cython`: For writing C extensions for Python.
        * `vmd-python`: Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) Python bindings.  The `conda-forge/label/cf202003::` part specifies a specific build from the conda-forge channel.

4.  **Clone the GetContacts repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/getcontacts/getcontacts.git](https://github.com/getcontacts/getcontacts.git)
    ```

    * This command clones the GetContacts code from its GitHub repository into a new directory named "getcontacts".

5.  **Change directory to the GetContacts folder:**

    ```bash
    cd getcontacts
    ```

    * This command changes the current directory to the "getcontacts" directory, where the GetContacts scripts are located.

6.  **Make the Python scripts executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x *.py
    ```

    * This command adds execute permissions to all files ending with ".py" (Python scripts) in the current directory. This is necessary to run the GetContacts scripts from the command line.
